Hi, there. Welcome to my blog. This is Krithic, your bumbling host. I have no idea how you made 
it to the corner of the interwebs. But now that you are here, let me show you around.

So why blog? Well, I have wanted to write a blog since high school to share what I have learned and 
after joining university I started grinding computer science and while I was at it I was reading 
blog posts(largely technical) by people like [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca), 
[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/) and from various other misc sites. Reading through, 
I felt that blogs do a much better job at explaining stuff, be it simple or some arcane stuff. So 
here I am trying to blog and document what I have learned and this is my queer attempt at it. 
FYI: This is the first time I am blogging so constructive criticisms would be nice I guess.

This blog will largely be technical. Why technical? Because way too many people know the basics and 
knowing the ins and outs of something and learning it hands-on really helps you learn better. I 
don't have any plans on what to blog though but I guess you will mostly find machine learning, 
blockchain stuff and some random thoughts.

Hopefully I will maintain this blog and probably inspire others to start their own blog. I am not 
making any promises though.
