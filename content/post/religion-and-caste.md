title: My thoughts on Religion and Caste in India

It was a fine morning and I was scrolling through reddit on my phone while taking a dump, I noticed
I was logged out of my account and I was too lazy to log back in with TOTP and stuff, I decided to
scroll through the frontpage which had a lot of posts from `r/india` and `r/IndiaSpeaks`. I was
scrolling through my feed only to find a bunch of posts about rape threats to Muslim women, people
vandalizing a Muslim shop, etc. I don't follow `r/india` or `r/IndiaSpeaks` so this was the first
time I saw this. Previously I had seen movies like `Article 15` and a few others and I am aware that
there is a lot of caste and religious discrimination in the north. But man did I find out how worse
it had gotten.

India is culturally diverse and as a result, there exist people in our country believing in a
plethora of religions. It is nice to have a diverse culture but the ordinary people (citizens) here
are being manipulated by people with power and money.

Why fight over something that doesn't even exist? As in something that fundamentally doesn't exist.
I mean, there is no such thing as Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, etc in science. Even if you argue
that religion is built on top of science and it establishes a way of living life, it definitely is
not serving it's intended purpose. So why fight over something like religion and caste? Why can't
people here respect other people's choices and beliefs?

I have linked the posts that triggered me to write this at the bottom of my rant. (all posts are
within the time frame of 2 days) These posts just make me sick. With this I don't see India catching
up with other countries.

Even my relatives make me sick. They (a few not everyone of course) vote for leaders based on their
caste. Like wtfffffff? seriously wtfff? I have little or no respect for them. We clearly need a
different government and it is time we choose our leaders right and hold them accountable.

There is a lot of caste and religious discrimination in the north, especially in Uttar Pradesh,
Gujarat and also not to mention Karnataka from the south. At least the place I live in, Tamilnadu,
is better cause there is relatively very little religious discrimination, although caste
discrimination still prevails in rural areas and even in many suburban households intercaste
marriage is still considered taboo.

This society doesn't give me hope at all. I apologize for sounding depressing but I think human
greed, ego and stupidness is the [great](https://www.nickbostrom.com/extraterrestrial.pdf)
[filter](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/greatfilter.html) we are destined to face in the bleak
future that lies ahead. God willing (chuckles) this weak society births a strong leader with a
**progressive** and positive vision for the future.

When is this hatred amongst ourselves going to end? Why are the common people so easy to manipulate?
How and why do the people with power easily manage to manipulate the common people? If you look
closely "a particular party" is most successful in the north and relatively not as successful in the
south. I would suspect that this is because of the lack of education for most people in the north. I
say this with zero research and this is not grounded. But that is the first place I would look into.

As I was writing this, an Instagram bio that I saw a few days ago and is pertinent to what we are
talking about comes to my mind. Here it is: `"why blood? same blood"`

I would like to quote a dialogue from the movie [Hey
Ram](https://piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=-K3DSBg_zdE). You can watch the video in the link if you
understand Tamil, if not here is a rough translation:

```
About thousands of years before Christ, even back then this civilization knew the need for a sewage
system. A civilisation where children were given toys to play. Not like ours where we adults use our
religion to fight each other with.
```
