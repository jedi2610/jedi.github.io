The past year has been great for AI. It's going through the same phase that crypto
did 2 years ago. So many breakthroughs in just a year from DALL·E 2, Imagen,
Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA, and music generation models like
Moûsai and MusicLM. Everyone's getting on the hypetrain from CS to non-CS
people. Diffusion models have been great for graphic designers. LLMs have been great for a lot of people from content
creators [to](to.md) even programmers, like last week I was stuck with writing
a CMake file and google didn't help me much, I then asked ChatGPT and came out
with the correct CMake file in a jiffy.

You are currently witnessing a transition of AI models being disruptive. It may
render many jobs obsolete in the near future. Like 3 years back, I didn't see
any of this coming. But here we are. We can only gaze on the short term effects
that AI would have within the next 5-10 years. But for the long term effects,
i guess it's a good time to read

if you haven't already.


In 5 years, I can see web developers gone for sure xd. Like seriously tho, if
you are a web dev, know that AI is coming for you. I was genuinely shocked by
the napkin to webpage demo from the GPT-4 livestream. It is one of the first CS
jobs I can see going away. AI models would also have effects on regular workforces.
Companies may not need 20 people to do a job, but instead may only need 10
people and a GPT-4. It's already in the phase of assisting humans, just that it
has not gone mainstream and not adopted as much by companies but it's just
a matter of time before that happens. LLM's are like having a "maybe expert"
personal assistant with you, like you still cannot fully rely on it, but it
gets most of the job done.

Or it's probably that I am just over-reacting and humans are here to stay.
