went to Westside to buy a shirt. took a look at the collections they had. liked most of them. but
they were a bit on the costlier side for me. thought about it for a minute, and i was like fuck it
all bro, just spend some money and enjoy your life. went on to pick all the clothes i liked and went
straight to the billing counter, without thinking about the price. billed all of em, it got to a
whooping 6000 rupees. i have never bought clothes for 6k in my entire life, even if you had to
account for an entire year, but i spent 6k on clothes in a single day. it really does feel very
different when you are able to spend money without thinking.
