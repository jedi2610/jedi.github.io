Hi there! I'm Krithic, a 2nd-year computer science student based in India. I have a passion for machine learning, blockchain and Linux. This is my blog for CS and cosmic stuff largely.
Outside of computers I love exploring and listening to old songs ranging from Beethoven and Chopin to Guns N' Roses and Metallica (strictly no zoomer music xD) and astrophysics.
I initially wanted to be an astrophysicist but then things went the other way and here I am, so yeah I'm relatively new to computers. Later I discovered my niche in computers and started enjoying coding and minimalist software.
