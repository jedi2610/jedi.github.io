				<p>Hi, there. Welcome to my blog. This is Krithic, your bumbling host. I have no idea how you made
it to the corner of the interwebs. But now that you are here, let me show you around.</p>
<p>So why blog? Well, I have wanted to write a blog since high school to share what I have learned and
after joining university I started grinding computer science and while I was at it I was reading
blog posts(largely technical) by people like <a href="https://vitalik.ca">Vitalik</a>,
<a href="https://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> and from various other misc sites. Reading through,
I felt that blogs do a much better job at explaining stuff, be it simple or some arcane stuff. So
here I am trying to blog and document what I have learned and this is my queer attempt at it.
FYI: This is the first time I am blogging so constructive criticisms would be nice I guess.</p>
<p>This blog will largely be technical. Why technical? Because way too many people know the basics and
knowing the ins and outs of something and learning it hands-on really helps you learn better. I
don&rsquo;t have any plans on what to blog though but I guess you will mostly find machine learning,
blockchain stuff and some random thoughts.</p>
<p>Also this site was designed to be as minimalistic as possible. I specifically went with a no
javascript website. I&rsquo;m tired of bloated websites. An ideal website:
<a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">https://motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will maintain this blog and probably inspire others to start their own blog. I am not
making any promises though.</p>
